We want NFC unlock to be available as part of all operating systems so all of our software development is open source 
and available on github.  Creating an open source product will also enable third parties to adopt the McLear Torus  
and consider making their devices NFC ready.  Our end goal is to produce a ring that will make your day to day life better.  We invision being able to use your ring as a pedometer, to monitor your heart rate, we have big plans for the future and we want you to be part of our journey.

We believe in sharing as much information as possible so we also publish useful links to documentation and other reference points on our github organization site.  This includes 3d models so you can 3d print your own ring at home.
