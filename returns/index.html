      <h1>Questions / Scenarios:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What if the app doesn&#x27;t work with my phone?</strong><br>
        The ring can be returned for a refund</li>
        <li><strong>What if the app stops working after 30 days?</strong><br>
        The NFC Ring unlock app comes with a warranty like any software you purchase. This warranty is limited to the verification and ring registration functionality of the app.</li>
        <li><strong>What if I lose my ring but need exactly the same ring inlays?</strong><br>
        There is nothing McLear Ltd can do about this. You will have to purchase a replacement ring.</li>
        <li><strong>Is there any possibility to organize back shipping from UK, for example in Switzerland where the shipment costs more than a new ring?</strong><br>
        Sadly no, maybe in the future when we expand we will find a way to make this feasible, but for now the best we can offer is shipping back to the UK or the US.</li>
        <li><strong>Is there a problem with overloading the ring involuntary during checkout (like the shops do with the RFID security tags)?</strong><br>
        TLDR; No. (See previous document revisions for full explanation.)</li>
        <li><strong>How should I package and ship my ring for return?</strong><br>
        Package your ring in a strong jiffy bag that wont split in shipping.  Ship your ring tracked.  If your ring fails to arrive with us there is very little we can do to help you.
